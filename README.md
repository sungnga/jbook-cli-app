## Steps to building this app
The codebase for each step can be found in the commit link

## IMPLEMENTING IN-BROWSER BUNDLING

### Project setup
- Create project with create-react-app
  - `npx create-react-app jbook-cli-app --template typescript --use-npm`
- Install esbuild package
  - `npm i --save-exact esbuild-wasm@0.8.27`
- Delete all the files in src folder and create an index.tsx file. Render a simple text to make sure the app works

### Creating basic form elements
- Create an input state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the content from input field in this state
- Create a code state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the code that esbuild has transpiled in this state
- Render a textarea input field and a Submit button

### Accessing the esbuild-wasm in the browser
- ESBuild docs: https://esbuild.github.io/
- We need to get access (download) the web assembly binary (wasm) inside of our React app
- Go into node_modules folder -> esbuild-wasm folder, and copy the esbuild.wasm file. Paste the file in public folder
- The reason why we're doing this is we need this esbuild web assembly inside of our browser. Every file that's placed inside the public directory of a create-react-app can be fetched very easily from inside the browser. This way the esbuild-wasm can fetch the binary code and does the transpiling for us

### Initializing ESBuild 
- Initialize ESBuild by calling `esbuild.startService()`
- What we get back is a service which we can use in our app to transpile and bundle code
- We only want to start this service once when our app is first loaded. So we make use of useEffect() to call this service

### Using refs for arbitrary values
- We want to make use of useRef() hook to keep a reference to a value inside of a component
- In our case, we want to keep a reference of the `service` value by assigning it to `ref.current`. We can then refer to `ref.current` anywhere inside of our component. This will give us a reference to the service we create through ESBuild. We can then use that to do our transpiling and bundling

### Transpiling code
- The transform function will transpile the provided code only and it's an asynchronous operation
- After we transpiled the code, we want to store the result in code state so that we can display it on our page
