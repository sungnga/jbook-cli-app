## Steps to building this app
The codebase for each step can be found in the commit link

## IMPLEMENTING IN-BROWSER BUNDLING

### Project setup
- Create project with create-react-app
  - `npx create-react-app jbook-cli-app --template typescript --use-npm`
- Install esbuild package
  - `npm i --save-exact esbuild-wasm@0.8.27`
  - ESBuild will allow us to transpile and bundle our code in the browser
- Delete all the files in src folder and create an index.tsx file. Render a simple text to make sure the app works

### Creating basic form elements
- Create an input state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the content from input field in this state
- Create a code state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the code that esbuild has transpiled in this state
- Render a textarea input field and a Submit button

### Accessing the esbuild-wasm in the browser
- ESBuild docs: https://esbuild.github.io/
- We need to get access (download) the web assembly binary (wasm) inside of our React app
- Go into node_modules folder -> esbuild-wasm folder, and copy the esbuild.wasm file. Paste the file in public folder
- The reason why we're doing this is we need this esbuild web assembly inside of our browser. Every file that's placed inside the public directory of a create-react-app can be fetched very easily from inside the browser. This way the esbuild-wasm can fetch the binary code and does the transpiling for us

### Initializing ESBuild 
- Initialize ESBuild by calling `esbuild.startService()`
- What we get back is a service which we can use in our app to transpile and bundle code
- We only want to start this service once when our app is first loaded. So we make use of useEffect() to call this service

### Using refs for arbitrary values
- We want to make use of useRef() hook to keep a reference to a value inside of a component
- In our case, we want to keep a reference of the `service` value by assigning it to `ref.current`. We can then refer to `ref.current` anywhere inside of our component. This will give us a reference to the service we create through ESBuild. We can then use that to do our transpiling and bundling

### Transpiling code
- The transform function will transpile the provided code only and it's an asynchronous operation
- After we transpiled the code, we want to store the result in code state so that we can display it on our page

### ESBuild bundling using unpkgPathPlugin
- When ESBuild is going through the process of bundling our code and when it sees lines of code like 'import/export/export.module', it tries to find the module in the file system
- We want to intercept this step and provide it the path to the module ourselves. We intercept this process with help of the unpkg-path-plugin
- The unpkg.com site will automatically return the path (usually found in the index.js file of a module) of a given NPM module
- In the unpkg-path-plugin.ts file, we overwrite the ESBuild's .onResolve() and .onLoad() functions
- For now we're just going hard-code in the import module just to test that the ESBuild bundling works


## DYNAMIC FETCHING & LOADING OF NPM MODULES

### Dynamically fetching modules
- If we try to fetch a file with a path besides index.js (usually as the entry point to a given module), then we make a request with axios to args.path(url). And this should give us back the contents of whatever file is at that url
- Then we want to take the data we've fetched, the contents of that file, and return an object from onLoad(). This object contains the contents that the ESBuild is trying to get of the file by accessing the file system. And we're providing it the contents here

### Generating the unpkg URL using the URL constructor
- The URL constructor will generate a url object, but we only want the href property inside of it. The href property has the fully form url
- This is still a naive approach to generating a path which doesn't work in all possible cases

### Resolving nested paths
- We want to bundle a module that has some nested file path inside of it
- In the onLoad function, we can provide the resolveDir property to the next file we're trying to resolve. The resolveDir describes where we found the last file of the import module
- Now the onResolve function receives as args an object that contains path, importer, namespace, and resolveDir properties
  - If the next file we're looking for is a relative path, update the URL constructor to include the resolveDir
- An example process to fetching a nested utils module:
  - onResolve
    - `{path: "index.js", importer: "", namespace: "", resolveDir: ""}`
    - ```ts
      if (args.path === 'index.js') {
        return { path: args.path, namespace: 'a' };
      }
      ```
  - onLoad
    - `{path: "index.js", namespace: "a"}`
    - ```ts
      if (args.path === 'index.js') {
        return {
          loader: 'jsx',
          contents: `
            const message = require('nested-test-pkg');
            console.log(message);
          `
        };
      }
      ```
  - onResolve
    - `{path: "nested-test-pkg", importer: "index.js", namespace: "a", resolveDir: ""}`
    - ```ts
      return {
        namespace: 'a',
        path: `https://unpkg.com/${args.path}`
      };
      ```
  - onLoad
    - `{path: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg", namespace: "a"}`
    - ```ts
      const { data, request } = await axios.get(args.path);
      return {
        loader: 'jsx',
        contents: data,
        resolveDir: new URL('./', request.responseURL).pathname
      };
      ```
  - XMLHttpRequestÂ 
    - `{responseURL: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src/index.js"}`
  - Data returned from request in index.js file
    - ```
      const toUpperCase = require('./helpers/utils');

      const message = 'hi there';

      module.exports = toUpperCase(message);
      ```
  - onResolve
    - `{path: "./helpers/utils", importer: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg", namespace: "a", resolveDir: "/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src"}`
    - ```ts
      if (args.path.includes('./') || args.path.includes('../')) {
        return {
          namespace: 'a',
          path: new URL(
            args.path,
            'https://unpkg.com' + args.resolveDir + '/'
          ).href
        };
      }
      ```
  - onLoad
    - `{path: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src/helpers/utils", namespace: "a"}`
    - ```ts
      const { data, request } = await axios.get(args.path);
      return {
        loader: 'jsx',
        contents: data,
        resolveDir: new URL('./', request.responseURL).pathname
      };
      ```
  - XMLHttpRequest
    - `{responseURL: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src/helpers/utils.js"}`
  - Data returned from request in utils.js file
    - ```
      module.exports = function (str) {
        return str.toUpperCase();
      };
      ```
    - Note that this file doesn't have another import/require module. So it won't try to go find the next file

### Setup defines during bundling
- ESBuild define docs: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define
- Define allows us to define a value inside of code whenever we are doing a bundling process
- When bundling we get a warning message
  - `warning: Define "process.env.NODE_ENV" when bundling for the browser`
- We need to setup ESBuild to define the value of "process.env.NODE_ENV" whenever we're doing a bundling
- We do the bundling in the ref.current.build() method and this is where we can include the `define` property


## CACHING FOR BIG PERFORMANCE GAINS

### Implementing a caching layer
- Whenever the onLoad function is about to make a request to unpkg.com, we want to implement a caching layer. In this cache object, we want to see if we have fetched that package before. If so, return it immediately. Otherwise, make the request and store the response inside the cache, and then return the response off to onLoad
- onLoad -> cache object -> unpkg.com
- We don't want to store our cache data in localStorage, because it maybe contain a lot of data and may potentially get deleted out of localStorage
- An alternative method of storing information inside the browser is indexedDB. Similar to localStorage, it's an information store that we can make use of inside the browser and can store much more information than localStorage
- We're going to use a helper library called localforage to help us work easier with indexedDB. It falls back on localStorage if the user's browser doesn't have indexedDB or WebSQL support
- Import: `npm i localforage`
- Caching with key-value pairs in the onLoad function after we made a request and fetched the data
  - The key is the path.args and the value is the return object from onLoad

### Fixing a Typescript error while caching

### Bundling user input
- Up until this point we have been hard-coding in the contents value for the index.js file, on which we specified as the entryPoints to tell ESBuild to start the bundling process there
- Now we want the value for this contents to come from the input state instead. This is the value that the user types into the textarea input field and we store it in input state. For example, the user may type in `const a = 1; console.log(a);`
- We need to communicate this value stored in input state to our plugin. In the `plugins` property, pass in the input state to the unpkgPathPlugin() method as an argument
- The unpkgPathPlugin function in the plugin file should receive the inputCode value as a parameter. Then in the onLoad function, if args.path is equal to index.js, we provide that value to the `contents` property
- So when a user submits a piece of code, ESBuild should be able to bundle that code

### Refactoring by breaking up resolve logic with filters
- We can define multiple different onResolve functions and use the filter to control the way in which we actually resolve a path rather than these if statements  

### Refactoring to multiple plugins
- Let's take the all the logic code around onLoad and extract it into a separate second plugin file. This will make it easier for us to understand all the different plugins inside of our project and it will make it easier to reuse these plugins in the future as our project grows
- Import the second plugin file in the main index.tsx file and then call the plugin method inside the plugins array

### Loading CSS files
- Docs for loading CSS files: https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#css
- Whenever ESBuild does some bundling, if we import CSS, ESBuild is going to output two separate files. The first containing all the JS code and the second containing all the CSS. In a normal circumstance, ESBuild will write these two output files to a file system. However, in our app, we don't have a file system for ESBuild to write to. We will get an error when we import a CSS file, even though we successfully able to fetch the CSS data from unpkg.com
- One work-around is to inject the CSS data into a JS code snippet and insert it in the head tag of the browser DOM
- If the fileType is `css`, then we use this JS code snippet as contents property. Otherwise, use the data that we get back from the request as contents 

### Refactoring onLoad with load filters
- We want to create different onLoad functions to handle different file types
- We want to handle the index.js file, the CSS files, and any other arbitrary files

### Extracting common caching logic
- Let's extract the duplicated caching logic into its own separate onLoad function. If we already have the fetched file cached in indexedDB, then we're just going to return the cachedResult

### A better way of loading WASM
- Previously, the way we load the esbuild.wasm (web assembly binary) file into our browser is by dragging the file into the public directory of our project. We've been hosting this web assembly ourselves in the public directory
- A better approach is to provide a link of the web assembly binary that is hosted on unpkg.com
- So whenever we start up ESBuild it'll go fetch the web assembly binary from unpkg.com instead
  - `wasmURL: 'https://unpkg.com/esbuild-wasm@0.8.27/esbuild.wasm'`


## SAFELY HANDLING UNTRUSTED CODE EXECUTION

### Considerations around code execution
- User-provided code might throw errors and cause our program to crash
  - Solution: if we execute a user's code in an iframe
  - Won't crash our application
- Use-provided code might mutate the DOM, causing our program to crash
  - Solution: if we execute a user's code in an iframe
  - If the user decides to mutate the DOM, they're mutating the DOM inside the iframe, not our parent document
- A user might accidentally run code provided by another malicious user
  - Solution: if we execute a user's code in an iframe with direct communication disabled
  - The user's JS code is being executed inside the iframe, so any malicious code cannot affect the parent document
- A use might accidentally run code in infinite loop causing the browser to crash

### Displaying iframes
- An iframe element is used to embed one html document into another. This is usually what an iframe is used for
- Create an html doc in public directory. Then create an iframe element inside the App component. We're going to use this iframe element to embed the html doc to display its content

### Direct access between frames
- Crossing context
  - The current settings of our iframe **allow** communication between the parent and the child. Can reach from the parent into the child iframe and vice versa and get access to different properties
- A direct access between frames is **allowed** when...
  - The iframe element does not have a `sandbox` property, or has a `sandbox="allow-same-origin"` property
  - **AND**
  - We fetch the parent HTML doc and the frame HTML doc from the exact same...
    - Domain
    - Port
    - Protocol (http vs https)
- To disallow direct access between frames...
  - In iframe element, add `sandbox=""`. This will isolate the contents from the iframe and add an extra layer of security
  - Or have the parent doc and the child doc served on different server ports

### The solutions for our app
- Sandboxing the child frame from the parent document, so there's no direct communication between frames and the child frame cannot have access to the parent contents
- The child doc and the parent doc will be served on the same localhost. We don't have to build an extra infrastructure to host the html doc on a different server and make the extra request to fetch the html doc. So our app will be very fast
- However, the downside to this approach is the child frame will be restricted from several in-browser features such as accessing localStorage or cookies, or run any Javascript code through scripts

### Our app flow
- We want to run something like 'jbook serve'
- This should start a server on localhost:4005
- User will write code into an editor
- We bundle in the browser
- We execute the user's code in iframe

### iframes with srcDocs
- In the iframe element, when we set the `src` property to some location, iframe will make a request to some external site to get the content
- However, the `srcDoc` property allows us to load up some content into an iframe using a string
- So we can make use of the `srcDoc` property to get the child frame html doc right inside of our application
- Even though the content of the child frame is generated locally inside of our app, by adding that `sandbox=""` in the iframe element, we are preventing communication between the child and the prevent

### Executing iframe using srcDoc
- Create an html string that contains a script tag and in the script tag contains the code state. The code state contains the bundle code generated by ESBuild of our user's code
- Assign the `srcDoc` property of the iframe element to this html string
- Set the `sandbox` property to allow the iframe to run scripts

### Passing code to the iframe
- Even though we disabled direct communication between frames, we can still have some indirect communication between frames using addEventListener. The parent document can listen for some message from the child frame and vice versa
- When a user submits their code -> we're going to bundle that code -> we're going to emit an event down to the iframe -> the iframe should receive that event and that event should contain all of our code -> the iframe can then execute that bundle code by calling eval() on event.data -> the result would be displayed in the iframe

### Highlighting errors in iframe
- If an error occurs while iframe executes the user's code, we not only want to display the error in the browser console, we also want to display the error message in the iframe. This way the user can see what just went wrong even if they don't have their development console open
- We style the error message in red color

### Resetting the iframe contents
- Let's say a user enters in some code and submits it, and then they add/delete more code or edit existing code and submit again. Now, we want to ensure that *each time before* a user's code get executed again, that it resets/reloads the entire iframe html document to its original state. It does a full refresh of the contents of the iframe
- This way a user will always have a very consistent environment and to make sure that we don't get any leakage of variables or states between different executions of their code
- To do this, right before we start the bundling process, we're going to update the `srcdoc` property of the iframe manually. We set the iframe.current `srcdoc` property to the html string that we created for the iframe html doc
- To test this out that the iframe html doc has been reset:
  - First enter in: `document.body.innerHTML = '';`
  - This empties out the body tag and also removes our root id
  - Then enter: `console.log(document.querySelector('#root'));`
  - We should get back a div tag that contains a root id


## DISPLAYING A CODE EDITOR IN A REACT APP

### Displaying a code editor
- We are going to use an open source browser-based code editor called Monaco Editor. It will give us an almost-perfect editing experience such as syntax highlighting, autocomplete, code linting, etc.
- Install: `npm i --save-exact @monaco-editor/react@3.7.5`
- monaco-editor/react docs: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react`
