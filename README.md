## Steps to building this app
The codebase for each step can be found in the commit link

## IMPLEMENTING IN-BROWSER BUNDLING

### Project setup
- Create project with create-react-app
  - `npx create-react-app jbook-cli-app --template typescript --use-npm`
- Install esbuild package
  - `npm i --save-exact esbuild-wasm@0.8.27`
  - ESBuild will allow us to transpile and bundle our code in the browser
- Delete all the files in src folder and create an index.tsx file. Render a simple text to make sure the app works

### Creating basic form elements
- Create an input state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the content from input field in this state
- Create a code state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the code that esbuild has transpiled in this state
- Render a textarea input field and a Submit button

### Accessing the esbuild-wasm in the browser
- ESBuild docs: https://esbuild.github.io/
- We need to get access (download) the web assembly binary (wasm) inside of our React app
- Go into node_modules folder -> esbuild-wasm folder, and copy the esbuild.wasm file. Paste the file in public folder
- The reason why we're doing this is we need this esbuild web assembly inside of our browser. Every file that's placed inside the public directory of a create-react-app can be fetched very easily from inside the browser. This way the esbuild-wasm can fetch the binary code and does the transpiling for us

### Initializing ESBuild 
- Initialize ESBuild by calling `esbuild.startService()`
- What we get back is a service which we can use in our app to transpile and bundle code
- We only want to start this service once when our app is first loaded. So we make use of useEffect() to call this service

### Using refs for arbitrary values
- We want to make use of useRef() hook to keep a reference to a value inside of a component
- In our case, we want to keep a reference of the `service` value by assigning it to `ref.current`. We can then refer to `ref.current` anywhere inside of our component. This will give us a reference to the service we create through ESBuild. We can then use that to do our transpiling and bundling

### Transpiling code
- The transform function will transpile the provided code only and it's an asynchronous operation
- After we transpiled the code, we want to store the result in code state so that we can display it on our page

### ESBuild bundling using unpkgPathPlugin
- When ESBuild is going through the process of bundling our code and when it sees lines of code like 'import/export/export.module', it tries to find the module in the file system
- We want to intercept this step and provide it the path to the module ourselves. We intercept this process with help of the unpkg-path-plugin
- The unpkg.com site will automatically return the path (usually found in the index.js file of a module) of a given NPM module
- In the unpkg-path-plugin.ts file, we overwrite the ESBuild's .onResolve() and .onLoad() functions
- For now we're just going hard-code in the import module just to test that the ESBuild bundling works


## DYNAMIC FETCHING & LOADING OF NPM MODULES

### Dynamically fetching modules
- If we try to fetch a file with a path besides index.js (usually as the entry point to a given module), then we make a request with axios to args.path(url). And this should give us back the contents of whatever file is at that url
- Then we want to take the data we've fetched, the contents of that file, and return an object from onLoad(). This object contains the contents that the ESBuild is trying to get of the file by accessing the file system. And we're providing it the contents here

### Generating the unpkg URL using the URL constructor
- The URL constructor will generate a url object, but we only want the href property inside of it. The href property has the fully form url
- This is still a naive approach to generating a path which doesn't work in all possible cases

### Resolving nested paths
- We want to bundle a module that has some nested file path inside of it
- In the onLoad function, we can provide the resolveDir property to the next file we're trying to resolve. The resolveDir describes where we found the last file of the import module
- Now the onResolve function receives as args an object that contains path, importer, namespace, and resolveDir properties
  - If the next file we're looking for is a relative path, update the URL constructor to include the resolveDir
- An example process to fetching a nested utils module:
  - onResolve
    - `{path: "index.js", importer: "", namespace: "", resolveDir: ""}`
    - ```ts
      if (args.path === 'index.js') {
        return { path: args.path, namespace: 'a' };
      }
      ```
  - onLoad
    - `{path: "index.js", namespace: "a"}`
    - ```ts
      if (args.path === 'index.js') {
        return {
          loader: 'jsx',
          contents: `
            const message = require('nested-test-pkg');
            console.log(message);
          `
        };
      }
      ```
  - onResolve
    - `{path: "nested-test-pkg", importer: "index.js", namespace: "a", resolveDir: ""}`
    - ```ts
      return {
        namespace: 'a',
        path: `https://unpkg.com/${args.path}`
      };
      ```
  - onLoad
    - `{path: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg", namespace: "a"}`
    - ```ts
      const { data, request } = await axios.get(args.path);
      return {
        loader: 'jsx',
        contents: data,
        resolveDir: new URL('./', request.responseURL).pathname
      };
      ```
  - XMLHttpRequestÂ 
    - `{responseURL: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src/index.js"}`
  - Data returned from request in index.js file
    - ```
      const toUpperCase = require('./helpers/utils');

      const message = 'hi there';

      module.exports = toUpperCase(message);
      ```
  - onResolve
    - `{path: "./helpers/utils", importer: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg", namespace: "a", resolveDir: "/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src"}`
    - ```ts
      if (args.path.includes('./') || args.path.includes('../')) {
        return {
          namespace: 'a',
          path: new URL(
            args.path,
            'https://unpkg.com' + args.resolveDir + '/'
          ).href
        };
      }
      ```
  - onLoad
    - `{path: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src/helpers/utils", namespace: "a"}`
    - ```ts
      const { data, request } = await axios.get(args.path);
      return {
        loader: 'jsx',
        contents: data,
        resolveDir: new URL('./', request.responseURL).pathname
      };
      ```
  - XMLHttpRequest
    - `{responseURL: "https://unpkg.com/nested-test-pkg@1.0.0/src/helpers/utils.js"}`
  - Data returned from request in utils.js file
    - ```
      module.exports = function (str) {
        return str.toUpperCase();
      };
      ```
    - Note that this file doesn't have another import/require module. So it won't try to go find the next file

### Setup defines during bundling
- ESBuild define docs: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#define
- Define allows us to define a value inside of code whenever we are doing a bundling process
- When bundling we get a warning message
  - `warning: Define "process.env.NODE_ENV" when bundling for the browser`
- We need to setup ESBuild to define the value of "process.env.NODE_ENV" whenever we're doing a bundling
- We do the bundling in the ref.current.build() method and this is where we can include the `define` property


## CACHING FOR BIG PERFORMANCE GAINS

### Implementing a caching layer
- Whenever the onLoad function is about to make a request to unpkg.com, we want to implement a caching layer. In this cache object, we want to see if we have fetched that package before. If so, return it immediately. Otherwise, make the request and store the response inside the cache, and then return the response off to onLoad
- onLoad -> cache object -> unpkg.com
- We don't want to store our cache data in localStorage, because it maybe contain a lot of data and may potentially get deleted out of localStorage
- An alternative method of storing information inside the browser is indexedDB. Similar to localStorage, it's an information store that we can make use of inside the browser and can store much more information than localStorage
- We're going to use a helper library called localforage to help us work easier with indexedDB. It falls back on localStorage if the user's browser doesn't have indexedDB or WebSQL support
- Import: `npm i localforage`
- Caching with key-value pairs in the onLoad function after we made a request and fetched the data
  - The key is the path.args and the value is the return object from onLoad

### Fixing a Typescript error while caching

### Bundling user input
- Up until this point we have been hard-coding in the contents value for the index.js file, on which we specified as the entryPoints to tell ESBuild to start the bundling process there
- Now we want the value for this contents to come from the input state instead. This is the value that the user types into the textarea input field and we store it in input state. For example, the user may type in `const a = 1; console.log(a);`
- We need to communicate this value stored in input state to our plugin. In the `plugins` property, pass in the input state to the unpkgPathPlugin() method as an argument
- The unpkgPathPlugin function in the plugin file should receive the inputCode value as a parameter. Then in the onLoad function, if args.path is equal to index.js, we provide that value to the `contents` property
- So when a user submits a piece of code, ESBuild should be able to bundle that code

### Refactoring by breaking up resolve logic with filters
- We can define multiple different onResolve functions and use the filter to control the way in which we actually resolve a path rather than these if statements  

### Refactoring to multiple plugins
- Let's take the all the logic code around onLoad and extract it into a separate second plugin file. This will make it easier for us to understand all the different plugins inside of our project and it will make it easier to reuse these plugins in the future as our project grows
- Import the second plugin file in the main index.tsx file and then call the plugin method inside the plugins array
