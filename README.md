## IMPLEMENTING IN-BROWSER BUNDLING

### Project setup
- Create project with create-react-app
  - `npx create-react-app jbook-cli-app --template typescript --use-npm`
- Install esbuild package
  - `npm i --save-exact esbuild-wasm@0.8.27`
- Delete all the files in src folder and create an index.tsx file. Render a simple text to make sure the app works

### Creating basic form elements
- Create an input state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the content from input field in this state
- Create a code state and initialize it to an empty string. We want to store the code that esbuild has transpiled in this state
- Render a textarea input field and a Submit button
